**IMPORTANT: In all cases you check if the pumps are clogged. If the
pump is clogged, replacement is not necessary, after cleaning the pump
can be used.**

Reassemble consists of the same steps in reverse.

While reassembling, take care that:

Make sure that the pumps are in the specified angle (check if during
servicing the holding metal sheet wasn’t bent) and the marked direction
of the flow is appropriate. In normal operation the device pumps the
water OUT of the boil tank.

Make sure that the wort outlet hose clamp is in the proper angle.
Otherwise you cannot reassemble the lower sheetmetal.
