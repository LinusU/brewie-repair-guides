IMPORTANT: First, turn the machine on, enter the Service Interface and
open all valves as valves can be removed only in open position.

Pull off the pipe clamp from the encircled fitting and bend back the
silicone pipe from the fitting.

give way for the valve..

After removal of the valve, check if the inner wall of the silicone tube
is clinged together. If it is clinged together, the valve replacement is
unnecessary, only the inner walls have to be separated.

Reassemble consists of the same steps in reverse.
